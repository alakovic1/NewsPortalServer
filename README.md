# NewsPortalServer

> NewsPortal server is server created for a NewPortal app. It's created in Spring Boot in Intelijj IDEA Ultimate. 
> I've created several routes for adding, editing, filtering and searching news.
> For data, I have used a simple list, but it can be done with PostgreSQL because I did it that way first.
